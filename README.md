# random or not so random
In the project, you will study the optimization algorithms related to the randomization. For a group of random algorithms, the randomness could be improved through certain strategy. The reference for this project comes from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.4184.pdf .

The mathematical problem discussed in the above paper is quite simple, however it provides some insights for data science, especially for linear problems. The conjecture in the paper is still an open problem in general.
